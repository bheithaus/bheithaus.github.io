I built a 3D visualization for an NGO working on clean burning cookstove technology to make help people in the developing world.  This interactive application helps the researchers and their colleagues better understand smoke particulate data that was collected inside of a smoky room during experiments.
A user can select which smoke sensor to monitor PM readings from, as the timeline moves at variable speed.
